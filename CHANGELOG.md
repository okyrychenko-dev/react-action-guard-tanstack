- 🎯 Scope-based blocking system
- 📊 Priority-based blocker management (queries: 10, mutations: 30)
- 💬 Dynamic reasons support for different states:
  - Query states: `reasonOnLoading`, `reasonOnFetching`, `reasonOnError`

### Features

- **Query Blocking**: Control blocking during initial loading, background fetching, and error states
- **Mutation Blocking**: Control blocking during pending and error states
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents invalid configurations (e.g., `reasonOnError` without `onError: true`)
- **Flexibility**: Works seamlessly with all TanStack Query features (callbacks, optimistic updates, etc.)
- **Priority System**: Higher priority blockers take precedence
- **Clean API**: Same API as TanStack Query with additional `blockingConfig` parameter

### Documentation
